# spline-breathing-ball

Our meditations for a brand project called Zen-ish are paired with a visual to help guide the meditator’s breath. I used Spline to create a breathing ball, using our primary brand color 6D0F53 in this deep wine purple.

The Base state of the sphere is set in one smaller position and another state in a bigger position.

The event is set to ease in and out at a speed of 6 on ping pong mode infinitely, so it has a breath affect that one could breath along with.

Since I am new to Spline, YouTube is extremely helpful for tutorials.

I used this one to complete this project: https://youtu.be/pUamUyt7EDU?si=fpnkTQ4stbcV7bZG

I would like to make the color effect more engaging, perhaps shinier, but I’ll save that for another tutorial.
